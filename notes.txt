Script order

1. Remove newlines from file - done!
2. Convert to using t[] instead of local variables
3. Remove the df[] array (it's useless)
4. Remove a assignments (e.g. t[1] = a[50] and replace all occurrences of t[1] with a[50]) - done!
5. Remove unused assignments - done!
6. Reassign shared computations / replace them in the file - done!
7. Reassign variables that don't get used afterwards - done!
8. Remove unused assignments - done!
9. Fix the indices to make things vectorizable (e.g. t[1] => t[1*8 + i]) / insert for loops
10. Profit

TODO:
 - Fix vectorization
 - Add another loop to poly-2b-v6x.cpp
    - The evaluation is already batched and memory is laid out contiguously
 - Change all necesssary header files
 - Run this script on other 2b / 3b files
